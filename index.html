            <li>Tony Stark was born, in 1970, as the first and only son to his parents, Howard and Maria Stark.</li>
            <li>He graduated MIT as a 17 year old in the top percentage.</li>
            <li>Though everything worked out for Tony in the classroom, at home he struggled in securing a good relationship with his father.</li>
            <li>At 21, his parents died in a "car crash" caused by the Winter Soldier, and he became the new owner of the weapons manufacturer, Stark Industries.</li>

            <li>Beginning in the first phase of Marvel, Tony Stark joined the Avengers as a sub-team of SHIELD. The team comprised of Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor.</li>
            <li>Being a successful scientist and inventor, Tony Stark created a new element, lead the Avengers to victory (despite creating the main villain, Ultron, from the 2nd Avengers movie), and he saved the universe countless times with his technology.</li>
            <li>When the Avengers broke apart, he stayed and worked for the International government, and he attempted to keep peace among all enemies who dared to threaten Earth. Tony worked for himself, though on paper he was controlled by the government agencies, but that never stopped him from making his own decisions.</li>
            <li>Eventually, Tony Stark, aka "Iron Man" sacrificed his life in order to keep the universe safe from Thanos, and he died saving the universe one last time.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Tony Stark left a lot of things behind. He left behind his family, friends, and the people who looked up to him around the world.</li>
            <li>The Avengers would never be the same without him or his leadership, for even during Tony's ego driven, rashful doings, the world was always safer because of it. </li>
            <li>In the bigger picture, Tony Stark taught valuable lessons through watching how he approaches problems in the movies. He was never one to shy away from learning something new, and he always dared to dream big no matter what obstacles might be in his way. Tony Stark is a fictional character, but maybe there is something in his story that can be applied to real life.</li>
